# Algebraic structures functions

This GitHub repository contains an algebraic structures laboratory project that allows to use of different algebra functions with Python.

## How it Works

The program is designed to have an interface and allow users to interact with different functions. It performs the following computations:

1. **Euler and Mobius functions**

2. **Legendre and Jacobi symbols**

3. **Factorization algorithm: Pollard's ro-algorithm**

4. **Algorithm for finding the discrete logarithm: the "large step - small step" algorithm**

5. **Algorithm for checking the number for simplicity: Solovey-Straussen algorithm**

6. **El-Gamal cryptosystem over elliptic curves**
